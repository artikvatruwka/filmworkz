The Video Player Challenge
Make a webpage containing TWO HTML5 video controls that will display the same video in both (local file).

Add one set of controls (play, pause, stop, etc) that control both videos at the same time, such that both videos always display the same frame. Add any features that you think make the page better.Â  

**For example:**
A timeline that can be scrubbed to choose which frame to display.
Display metadata (video name, resolution, framerate, codec type etc).
Overlay the current frame number (or timecode) over the videos.
The ability to zoom in on the videos, both videos zooming in at the same time.
When zoomed in add the ability to pan (drag) the visible part of the videos.
The ability to stream online videos as well as local files.

**Preferred Tech:** *Javascript (pref Typescript), React, CSS, HTML.
